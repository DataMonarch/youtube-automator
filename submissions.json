For years, it was the only supermarket in all of Sydney, that was allowed to open on Christmas Day...every other supermarket had to close. Why was this one allowed to open? Well, the supermarket was over two levels, and the owners discovered that if they registered each level as a separate business, they could open, as the size of the shop floor for each level was within the maximum size of a business allowed to open on Christmas Day, but combined they would be over the maximum size. All they had to do was ensure that there was a register downstairs to comply...so they put a little coffee shop downstairs. One year, that coffee shop only sold two cups of coffee for the entire shift."]]}, "zzr2dd": {"title": "I'm a Cashier, Not a Daycare Worker", "flair": "Medium", "top_comment": ["j2d6ucl", [392, "What kind of slimeball a.)
